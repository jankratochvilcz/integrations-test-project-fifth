# GitHub Labels Syncing

As discussed, we're adding label syncing to help us keep labels across our many repos in sync.
* Adding a new label to a specific repo replicates it to other repos
* Modifying a new label in the originating repo updates it everywhere
* Deleting a label deletes it in all repos

For testing, I recommend setting up a few empty repos in your private GitHub account so that you can freely play without risking the mass destruction of our labels.
